# PLPlotメモ

## plenv

> `plenv`: Sets up plotter environment for simple graphs by calling pladv and setting up viewport and window to sensible default values. plenv leaves a standard margin (left-hand margin of eight character heights, and a margin around the other three sides of five character heights) around most graphs for axis labels and a title. When these defaults are not suitable, use the individual routines plvpas, plvpor, or plvasp for setting up the viewport, plwind for defining the window, and plbox for drawing the box.
